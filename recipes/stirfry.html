        <h3>Stir Fry</h3>
        <p>Just do it. It cannot turn out bad, unless you burn it. I dunno where the sauce went. Ask Gordon Ramsey.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>4 boneless pork loin chops, cut into bite sized pieces</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon hot chile paste</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons teriyaki sauce</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, cut into strips</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into strips</li>
            <li>1 yellow bell pepper, cut into strips</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup blanched slivered almonds</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint </li>
        </ul></p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p><ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together rice wine vinegar, garlic, brown sugar, olive oil, and salt and pepper. Stir in pork pieces, cover, and leave at room temperature for 1/2 hour.</li>  
            <li>Heat a large wok over medium heat. Toast almonds in hot, dry wok until golden brown and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in wok over medium-high heat. Stir in marinated pork pieces, ginger, and chile paste. (Discard remaining marinade.) Mix in teriyaki sauce, and increase heat to high; cook, stirring constantly, until pork is white. Stir in peppers, and continue to stir fry until most of the liquid has evaporated. Top with toasted almond slivers and fresh mint.</li>
